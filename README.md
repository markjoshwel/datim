## Installation

```
pip install datim
```

Alternatively, install `datim[optional]` and get progress bar support.

## Usage

datim has four commands:


- `datim`
- `imdat`
- `datimp`
- `imdatp`

`datim` and `imdat` check whether the compiled variant of datim is installed.
If unavailable, it will fallback to the pure Python variant of datim.
`datimp` and `imdatp` _exclusively_ use the pure Python variant of the module.

```
$ datim
usage: datim [-h] [-o] [-np] [-nc] [-na] input output

(compiled) turns any file into an image

positional arguments:
  input               input file path
  output              output file path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -o, --overwrite     overwrite without confirmation
  -np, --no-progress  do not use tqdm
  -nc, --no-compress  do not compress data
  -na, --no-alpha     do not use alpha channel
```

```
$ imdat
usage: imdat [-h] [-o] [-np] [-nc] [-na] input output

(compiled) turns previously converted images into the original file

positional arguments:
  input               input file path
  output              output file path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -o, --overwrite     overwrite without confirmation
  -np, --no-progress  do not use tqdm
  -nc, --no-compress  do not compress data
  -na, --no-alpha     do not use alpha channel
```

## Technical Details

An image created by datim is made up by the following:
`[header][data][trailing 0s]`

- `[header] -> "<length of [data] hex array encoded in base15 hex>F"`

  This is made up of a base15 hex array (0-E) denoting the length of the
  (compressed) data hex array. It is then suffixed with a hex `F`, acting as a
  delimiter betweeen the `[header]` and `[data]` section. This method of
  storing the data hex array was chosen as to not use the alpha layer, which
  would increase the resulting image file size.

- `[data]`

  The (compressed) data is expressed naturally as its hexidecimal counterparts.

- `[trailing 0s]`

  After the `[data]` hex array are trailing `0`s. Before 2.0.0, trailing data
  were randomly generated for cosmetic purposes, but was removed due for
  performance. The reason for the trailing data is due to all output images
  being squares which may fit data that has a length perfectly square
  root-able, which most data is not.
